Welcome to NDN-CCL's documentation!
===================================

The bulk of hours spent working on code is in some form of maintenance (often not performed by the initial author). There are many disparate programming and commenting styles in use today, however. This implies a need for a common set of conventions so that maintainers do not have to learn, recognize and adapt to a constantly changing code base.
Since the maintainer of the code is often not the author, extensive commenting is very important in order to allow a maintainer to quickly come up to speed on the design, conceptual models and implementation of the code. A common coding and commenting scheme can make for easier to read, easier to understand, easier to maintain and more bug-free code.
When writing code for NDN-CCL, we therefore ask that you follow these relatively widely accepted coding standards. This document thus outlines guidelines we plan to enforce on each component integrated in NDN-CCL to ensure uniformity of the codebase which is a first step towards readable code.

The following recommendations are not strict rules and some of them are conflicting but the point here is to outline the fact that we value more common-sense than strict adherence to the coding style defined in this document.
